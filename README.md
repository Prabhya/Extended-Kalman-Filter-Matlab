# Extended-Kalman-Filter-Matlab
This repository contains matlab programs, to implement Linear and Extended Kalman Filters

Extended_Kalman_Filter.m file is matlab file to generate synthetic positions of maneuvering target and then generate sensor reading.
EKF is used to filter out the measurement noise.

ode4.m is fixed step ode solver. It can be obtained easily, however i attached it as it is being used in the program.

The results are also posted
